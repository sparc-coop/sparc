# Introduction 
Sparc strives for a world where startups are owned by those who built it.

We are building a community of individuals & organisations who believe there is a better way to fund, 
build and reward startups. Sparc Cooperative is a verifiedÂ Worker Cooperative, all the way down to our bylaws.
This means that at sparc, money does not buy power. Every person owns an equal share and has an equal vote. no matter their job. 
No external investment can dictate the direction the Sparc team goes.
No single person walks away with the majority of the profit. 
And no person's skill or opinion is less important than another's.
